# Decentralized Governance Contract

## Overview
A Stacks blockchain smart contract that enables decentralized proposal creation, voting, and decision-making.

## Contract Features
- Proposal creation
- Voting mechanism
- Proposal finalization
- Transparent voting tracking

## Data Structures

### Proposals
- Unique proposal ID
- Title
- Description
- Proposer address
- Vote counts (yes/no)
- Proposal status
- Optional execution parameters

## Key Functions

### `create-proposal`
- Create new governance proposals
- Set title and description
- Optional execution parameters
- Generates unique proposal ID

### `vote`
- Cast votes on active proposals
- Prevents multiple votes per user
- Tracks yes/no vote counts

### `finalize-proposal`
- Determine proposal outcome
- Change proposal status based on voting results
- Supports "passed" or "rejected" statuses

## Voting Mechanics
- One vote per user per proposal
- Simple majority determines proposal outcome
- Transparent vote tracking

## Error Handling
- Prevents duplicate voting
- Checks proposal existence
- Validates proposal status
- Unauthorized action prevention

## Proposal Lifecycle
1. Proposal Creation
2. Voting Period
3. Proposal Finalization
4. Status Determination

## Potential Improvements
- Quorum requirements
- Voting weight mechanisms
- Time-based proposal expiration
- More complex execution logic
- Delegation of voting rights

## Security Considerations
- Unique vote tracking
- Status-based action restrictions
- Transparent proposal management

## Use Cases
- Decentralized decision making
- Community governance
- Protocol upgrades
- Resource allocation

## Deployment
Deploy on Stacks blockchain using Clarinet or similar development tools.

## Best Practices
- Clear proposal descriptions
- Transparent voting process
- Fair decision-making mechanism
